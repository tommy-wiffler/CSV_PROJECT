# CSV_Project
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

this project is to teach students how to use CSV files in python
this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib

In this project, we input files and manipulated the data to produce graphs of temperature data from different weather stations. There are 5 files that represent different checkpoints on the way to the final graph in file number 5. In file number 5, the indices, labels, and titles are all automated to where one can load any csv file that is formatted corresponding to the code can be loaded into the program and produce temperature graphs.
